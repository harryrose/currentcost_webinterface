currentcost_webinterface
========================

A web interface to the current cost data.

Currently it is all very much hacked together (as it was something I wanted to get working fairly quickly...).  
I'm planning on rewriting a lot of this to use another graphing library that handles large volumes of data 
more gracefully and allows sensor.php to output data in different formats.
